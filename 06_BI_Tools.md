## Metabase Basics
- **Dashboards** are great when you have a set of answers that you want to view together. Your saved questions will be displayed as cards on the dashboard, which you can resize and move around.
- **Metrics** are an easy way to refer to a computed number (for example, revenue).
- **Segments** are filters that you can easily reference in the query builder.

## usecases
1. BI tools -  a bunch of KPIs, and getting updates on these metrics by email, pushing data throughout the organisation.
2. look up user info without having to build custom admin pages
3. Browser for the database
