- **Dashboards** are great when you have a set of answers that you want to view together. Your saved questions will be displayed as cards on the dashboard, which you can resize and move around.
- **Metrics** are an easy way to refer to a computed number (for example, revenue).
- **Segments** are filters that you can easily reference in the query builder.
