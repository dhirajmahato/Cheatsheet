## Node.js
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library.
When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.
This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency.

## Node.js Applications
- Web Servers and APIs: Node.js is commonly used to build web servers and APIs. It's lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for handling a large number of concurrent connections. Frameworks like Express.js provide a robust and flexible way to build RESTful APIs and web applications.

- Real-time Applications: Node.js is well-suited for real-time applications that require bi-directional communication between clients and servers, such as chat applications, collaborative tools, and online gaming platforms. Libraries like Socket.IO enable real-time communication over WebSocket and other protocols.

- Microservices: Node.js is increasingly used in microservices architectures where applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate with each other via APIs. Its lightweight nature and support for asynchronous operations make it ideal for building and scaling microservices.

- Streaming Services: Node.js is used in streaming services for tasks like processing and serving audio and video content. Libraries like ffmpeg.js allow Node.js applications to manipulate media files, transcode them, and stream them to clients efficiently.

- IoT (Internet of Things): Node.js is employed in IoT applications for collecting, processing, and analyzing data from IoT devices. Its event-driven architecture makes it suitable for handling asynchronous events generated by IoT sensors and devices.

- Proxy Servers and Reverse Proxies: Node.js can be used to build proxy servers and reverse proxies that handle incoming requests, route them to the appropriate backend servers, and perform tasks like load balancing and caching.

- Data Streaming and Processing: Node.js is used in applications that involve data streaming and processing, such as log aggregation, real-time analytics, and IoT data processing. Libraries like Kafka.js and Apache Storm enable Node.js applications to handle large volumes of data in real-time.

- Serverless Computing: Node.js is a popular choice for serverless computing platforms like AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions. Developers can write functions in Node.js that are triggered by events and executed in response to requests, without managing the underlying infrastructure.
