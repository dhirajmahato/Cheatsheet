Think of an example stats: A **population** represents every single liver cell (within which whatever you are measuring)

**Population Parameters** that determine how a distribution fits a population data are called population paramters. we rarely, if ever, have population data, so we always estimate population parameters. Along with that we also estimate how much confidenece we should have in those estimates, generally speaking, the more data we have, the more confidence we have in the estimates.

By estimating the population parameters and quantifying the confidence in them, we can generate results that are reproducible in future experiments.

1. Frequentist
- P-value
- Confidence interval
2. Bayesian
