## GenAI Pipelines

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are specialized deep learning models tailored for processing visual data. They utilize convolutional layers to extract features and recognize spatial patterns in images.
**Transfer learning** in CNN architecture involves utilizing pre-trained CNN models to address new image-related tasks.
