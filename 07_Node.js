## Node.js
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library.
When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.
This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency.
